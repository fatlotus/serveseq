# ServeSeq: http.ServeMux, but for sequencing

ServeSeq is like http.ServeMux, except that it runs one http.Handler after
another. It is designed to allow you to do two things:

1. Authentication (pre-filtering) middleware.
2. Overlaying static handlers with dynamic handlers.

In this way, it does most of what a web framework would need to, without adding
a hugely complicated API, or new types.

## Example

Suppose we want to build an app with authentication and a custom error page. We
start by defining a basic login handler. ServeSeq skips the remaining handlers
if we write a response, so if we are logged in, the handler simply falls
through.

```go
// If the user is not logged in, redirect to the login page.
func RequireLogin(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	if r.URL.Path == "/login" {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "[login form]")

	} else if r.FormValue("session") == "" {
		http.Redirect(w, r, "/login", 307)
	}
}
```

Next, we define what happens _after_ the application. In this case, we override
the default 404 handler and provide our own message.

```go
// Capture any unhandled requests.
func CustomNotFound(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	w.WriteHeader(404)
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "not found :(")
}
```

We can glue these two functions before and after a standard `http.ServeMux`. 

```go
func main() {
	// Create a conventional application.
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	mux.HandleFunc("/app", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "hello world!")
	})

	// Compose it with some middleware.
	seq := serveseq.New()
	seq.NextFunc(RequireLogin)
	seq.Next(mux)
	seq.NextFunc(CustomNotFound)

  http.ListenAndServe(":9000", seq)
}
```

VoilÃ ! Simple, type-safe composition.
